## Brief About the project

- Your challenge is to build out this entertainment web application and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

- You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

- We provide the data in a local data.json file, so use that to populate the content on the first load. If you want to take it up a notch, feel free to build this as a full-stack application!
